Assignment 1
The first class we discussed how computers process code. The compiler is the thing that changes 
the human written code into machine code which is understandable by the operating system. The compiler
 creates a new file known as the executable that the operating system tries to read and execute the task.
  The computer has a CPU which handles all the tasks. It allocates everything into the memory and the executable 
  file runs tasks using those allocations. The machine code that is generated by the compiler consists of 1s
   and 0s only. This sequence of 1s and 0s is how the computer understands how to perform tasks. The source
    code that is created  by the human can work on multiple operating systems but a binary executable generated 
    in windows OS will not work in a Linux OS so different operating systems have different compilers and each
     generate a new binary executable that the OS understands.
