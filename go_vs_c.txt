Go is better than C/C++ because it has a better garbage collection for safe memory use. 
This prevents leaks and unused data is re-used again.

The main advantage of using this language over any other is that it is very good for concurrent programming.
It can run multiple processes at the same time with different threads.
Go code is very much simpler than C/C++ as it does not have unnecessary brackets/parentheses
and has a lot more built in funcitions to write code easily. 

GO is a high level language which makes it easy to read and code whereas C++ is a mid level language which makes
it harder to read and code. GO is top-bottom approach language so you code only details that are relevant to you
whereas C++ is a bottom-top language which means you code every little thing to make the program fully controllable.

GO has significantly quicker compile time than C/C++, the reason being C++ code is longer and complex due to 
which the compile time is longer for large programs.
It also has quicker time when we're comparing with writing the code as Go is much easy to code
Compile speed matters a lot because a code for a larger program needs to be tested/compiled several times to check for 
errors/functionality and if the compilation time is longer, it reduces efficiency.

C++ has constructors and deconstructors for its classes and structs which make the program longer and coding part 
harder. GO doesnt have these as it uses concurrency.

Golang can boast speeds of close to four times quicker than other interpreted and dynamic languages.

A major vulnerability of C/C++ is the buffer overflow problem when large data doesnt get stored into memory
correctly and it leads to holes and can cause crashes to the system. GO has limitaitons set to 
overcome this problem that comes in C language and there is very minimal chance buffer overflow problem in Go.
There can be buffer overflow problem in Go but it is very rare because it makes sure that the programmer checks
bounds to prevent this. C++ is not very strict like Go so it can lead a programmer to have this vulnerability.

Go is  a procedural language which means the program will follow steps in order we want them to execute,
whereas C++ is object oriented so we have to control all actions which makes code more complex and detailed
That is why if we want to change a built-in function in Go, it is very difficult and if you want to do the same
in C++, it allows you to do it easily.
